# Hackathon Ideas

1. Eye Tracking - Use a webcam to track the user's eye movements when they read a text. And use that text to generate pictures, music (white noise, etc.), lighting, etc. to create a more immersive reading experience.

2. Multiple images on multi monitors

3. Orchestrate images in multipule monitors

Feel free to add more ideas to the list!
